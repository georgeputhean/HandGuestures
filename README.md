# Hand Gesture Recognition for Finger Counting

## Overview
Hand Gesture Recognition for Finger Counting is a real-time computer vision system that detects and counts the number of fingers raised in a hand gesture. It uses the MediaPipe library for hand landmark tracking and a finger counting algorithm to analyze landmarks. The system provides a user-friendly interface with various potential applications.

## Key Features
- Real-time hand landmark detection.
- Finger counting algorithm for accurate finger counting.
- User-friendly interface displaying live video feed and finger count.
- Educational tool for finger counting and potential sign language recognition.
- Enhance interactive gaming experiences and human-computer interaction.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- mediapipe
- opencv-python
